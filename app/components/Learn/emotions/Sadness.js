        <h2>What is sadness?</h2>
        <p>People feel sad for many reasons, including when they are lonely, helpless, or disappointed.</p>
        <p>Maybe someone they care about is no longer around. Maybe they feel left out. Maybe they were hoping for something to happen but it didn't.</p>

        <p>When was the last time you felt sad? How did you deal with feeling sad?</p>
